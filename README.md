# css-frameworks-ca

## Noroff Social
This is my first time working with bootstrap and sass.
Noroff Social is a super creative name I admit. (Irony.)
The project includes a login page with html form validation.
A responsive feed page displaying blog posts. A form to create a new post.
Profile page where the users posts are displayed and profile picture. Buttons to follow that user or edit your own profile.

As of right now the project includes a small amount custom scss but a few bootstrap variables overrides.

## Built with
* HTML
