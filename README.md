# CodeUnity
In the start of the second semester, we were tasked to make a profile-, feed- and autenthication-page for a social media application. I spent some time thinking about what kind of application I wanted to develop, and landed on CodeUnity. My thought behind it, was "can I make something that solves a real problem?". Throughout my studies, I've missed having an organized and easy platform where you can make groups with fellow students, give feedback on specific posts to each other (instead of getting feedback that gets mixed with everything else that gets written), send each other messages and follow other student's progress and activity. Therefore; CodeUnity (Coding and Community).

## Description
After figuring out which kind of application I wanted to make, I made wireframes and design in Figma. I wanted to make a design that is easy to navigate, but at the same time something that is playful and nice. The project was developed using HTML, Bootstrap and Sass, aswell as JavaScript.
