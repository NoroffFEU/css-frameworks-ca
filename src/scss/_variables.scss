$primary: #bbecfc; // does not affect my live server preview
$body-bg: orange; // only causes a change on my live server preview momentarily

// I have tried opening live server on different browsers aswell, but it still does not work.
// Color changes seem to be functional within the code, but not on the live server preview.
// These are not my intended colors, but I am just trying to get the live server to work.
