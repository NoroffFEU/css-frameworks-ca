# css-frameworks-ca

A simple application for Noroff Social.
The project includes a login page with html form validation.
A responsive feed page displaying blog posts. A form to create a new post.
Profile page where the users posts are displayed and profile picture. Buttons to follow that user or edit your own profile.

As of right now the project includes very little custom scss but a few bootstrap variables overrides.
