# EcoConnect some app

prinscreen of the design of my project

## The some app

The purpose of this project was to apply knowledge of Bootstrap and SASS in building a responsive front end for a social media application.

In this brief we were asked to create 3 pages in HTML using Bootstrap and SASS:

- Authentication Page (/index.html): A form for login or registration with HTML validation. The form should use /profile as the action attribute. The password field must have a minimum length of 8 characters.

- Feed Page (/feed/index.html): This page should display a list of post thumbnails, include a search bar, sorting options, and a form to create a new post. Additional design features are encouraged.

- Profile Page (/profile/index.html): Features should include a profile image, username, a list of user posts, a follow button, and an area to display following/followers.

Note: Only Bootstrap UX functionality is required; there's no need for custom JavaScript beyond this.
