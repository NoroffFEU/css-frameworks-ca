# EcoConnect some app

prinscreen of the design of my project

## The some app

### Goal

The purpose of this project was to apply knowledge of Javascript in building a responsive front end for a social media application, utilizing the Noroff API for social media interactions.

## API

The application interacts with the Noroff API, specifically using the Social Endpoints for user authentication and content management. Users must register and login to obtain a JWT token and an API Key for accessing the protected routes.

### Required Features

- Registration and Login:** Users with @noroff.no or @stud.noroff.no email can register and login.
- Content Interaction:** Users can view, filter, search, create, update, and delete post content.
- Authentication and Authorization:** Utilizes JWT tokens and API Keys for secure access.
- Documentation:** Key functions are documented using JSDocs, ensuring clarity and maintainability.
