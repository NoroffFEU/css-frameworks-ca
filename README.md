## Description

### Project Brief

This project started as a brief to create 3 pages in HTML using Bootstrap and SASS:

- Authentication page (/index.html)
- Feed Page (/feed/index.html)
- Profile page (/profile/index.html)

The application has now been extended with JavaScript to add the following features:

- User with @noroff.no or @stud.noroff.no email can register profile
- Registered user can login
- User can view a post content feed
- User can filter the post content feed
- User can search the post content feed
- User can view a post content item by ID
- User can create a post content item
- User can update a post content item
- User can delete a post content item

To complete the required features, the application makes use of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods. The application also uses localStorage, especially for storing JWT tokens.

The application uses a provided API and API documentation to create a functioning user interface that allows for viewing, posting, editing, and deleting social media content.
