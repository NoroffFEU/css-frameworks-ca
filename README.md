# Goal
To apply knowledge of Bootstrap and SASS to build a responsive front end for a social media application.
There is no requirment for JS functionality beyond Bootstrap UX behaviour..

# Brief
In this brief we were asked to create 3 pages in HTML using Bootstrap and SASS:

# 1.Homepage 
The authentication page should have a form to login or register to the application. Ensure to include HTML form validation and use /profile as the action attribute. Password must have a minimum length of 8 characters.

# 2. Feed page
The feed page should have a list of posts thumbnails, a search bar, sort options and a form to create a new post. You may add additional design features beyond these requirements.

# 3.Profile page
The profile page should have a profile image, username, list of user posts, follow button and an area to display following/followers.
