# css-frameworks-ca

In this project we were tasked with using bootstrap and SASS to build a simple website.

I think that I have completed the task as it is supposed to be done but I didnt get any feedback after asking one of the teachers for help.

I feel somewhat lost with this as the CA itself was kind of back and forth in what it was asking for so im not sure that I did what it was asking me to do, but from my understanding it looks like a website the CA described.

I am open to feedback but I am hoping I do not have to redo the whole assignment as I asked for help at the start of the week with no response, leaving me with very little to go on moving forward.
