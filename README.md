# Charlotte Valset - CSS-frameworks-ca

![image](images/dancehub.jpg)

I am a front-end developer student at Noroff and a UX designer, please check out my CSS Framework assignment, a social-app site for dancers - [DanceHub](https://dancehub.netlify.app)

## Description

I made the design and wireframes in Figma, followed by building a fully responsive website using Bootstrap and styling it with SASS.

I had to use custom classes on a couple of places where I couldn't figure out how to style it with Bootstrap and SASS. If you find a way to fix it using Bootstrap and SASS, let me know!
