## Course assignment

Goal
To apply knowledge of JavaScript techniques to implement the front-end functionality for a social media application.

API
The API you are using for this project can be found under Social Endpoints in the Noroff API documentation.

Brief
You have been tasked with producing a new JavaScript front-end client for an existing social media platform. The client application must be attractive and responsive, but you have an otherwise blank slate in terms of theme design language.

Using the provided API and API documentation, create a functioning user interface that allows for viewing, posting, editing and deleting social media content.

Social API routes require both a JWT token and an API Key. You will need to register an account and login to access your token.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To complete the required features, you will also need to make use of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods.

Using localStorage is highly recommended, especially for storing JWT tokens.

A finished project fulfils the requirements below with an easy to use and error-free user interface.

Required features
The following user stories are required for a passing submission:

User with @noroff.no or @stud.noroff.no email can register profile
Registered user can login
User can view a post content feed
User can filter the post content feed
User can search the post content feed
User can view a post content item by ID
User can create a post content item
User can update a post content item
User can delete a post content item
