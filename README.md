The purpose of this project was to create and build a responsive front end for a social media application and with the knowledge of Bootstrap and SASS.

## Description

In this brief we were asked to create 3 pages in HTML using Bootstrap and SASS:

1.Homepage 
The authentication page should have a form to login or register to the application. Ensure to include HTML form validation and use /profile as the action attribute. Password must have a minimum length of 8 characters.

2. Feed page
The feed page should have a list of posts thumbnails, a search bar, sort options and a form to create a new post. You may add additional design features beyond these requirements.
