            <p>Hey, it's me, Rick Sanchez. I'm a mad scientist. You could say
              that I'm a bit of a genius, but don't let that go to your head.
              I've been around the block a few times, and I've seen some things that would make your head spin. I've
              been
              to
              different dimensions and universes, traveled through time, and even battled aliens. But through it all,
              I've
              remained true to myself.</p>
