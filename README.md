# Css-frameworks-ca

Twister, by Aleksander Storum, is an imaginary social media where users can post short messages in the form of either jokes, riddles or quotations. The user can also follow users of interest, and read content tailored to the user in the feed.

## Changes/problems

As Bootstrap and Sass is a new area for me, I found it a bit difficult to understand how to use it effectively compared to regular CSS. I also found the training module somewhat frustrating, as the combination of content, installations and tasks was a bit difficult to understand immediately. Fortunately, I think I have understood the main points, although I could perhaps use the various SASS concepts to a greater extent. I also had a bit of a hurry at the end, and with better time I would have implemented bigger design differences between the mobile solution and the web version. I only used the mobile version and made it responsive for larger screens (See Figmafiles). Some design considerations were also changed from Figma to implementation, such as fonts and some colors.
