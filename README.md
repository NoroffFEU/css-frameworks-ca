## Social media site - Stronger together

![Social media site - Stronger together](images/readme-img.jpg)

In this project the task was to create a social media site using Bootstrap and SASS with essential pages like:

-   Sign in page
-   Feed page
-   Profile page

## Description

The project involved Adobe XD for design and HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and SASS for website development.

Elements that had to be implemented in the project:

-   Sign in page: Form validation
-   Feed page: List of posts thumbnails, a search bar, sort options and a form to create a new post
-   Profile page: a profile image, username, list of user posts, follow button and an area to display following/followers

There were no requirments for JS functionality beyond Bootstrap UX behaviour. For example, using the provided dropdowns were acceptable without further custom JS.

As I continue to learn JavaScript I will improve the site accordingly.
