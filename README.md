For this school project, I have been creating a social media application using HTML, Bootstrap, and Sass. The social media application will consist of three pages: a login page, a profile page, and a feed page.

The login page will be the first page that users see when they visit the site. It will have a form where users can enter their login credentials, such as their username and password. Once the user logs in, they will be redirected to their profile page.

The profile page will be a page where users can view their personal information, such as their profile picture, name and city. Users will also be able to view their posts and followers.

The feed page will be the main page of the social media application, where users can view posts and interact with other users. Users will be able to post updates, like and comment on other users' posts.
